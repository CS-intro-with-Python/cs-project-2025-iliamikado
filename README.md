## Description

### Multiplayer Minesweeper

Every new day, a game will be created and anyone can play. \
The board is "infinite"â€”new squares are generated as they are discovered. \
A leaderboard displays how many squares each player has discovered. \
If someone discovers a mine, they die (cannot play the game anymore, or for a certain period of time), and a crater forms on the board. \
The players' goal is to discover as many squares as possible, make a minimum of mistakes, and reach the top of the leaderboard.
